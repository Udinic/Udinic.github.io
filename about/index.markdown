Hi, I'm Udi and I love building things.

I'm a software engineer, a father and a master of fixing things that aren't really broken. I work at Facebook on some of our most critical Android infrastructures, where I regularly practice my optimization skills, as well as my patience. I've been developing on Android since 2.2 (Froyo), but my passion for mobile started in the J2ME/Symbian days.

I like to create elaborate technical solutions to solve inconveniences in my life. My side projects range from automated scripts to designing electrical circuits, depending on the "problem". I created this blog to share some of the interesting stuff I've been working on, challenges I faced and lessons I learned and hope will benefit others. 

**Articles and publications**:

- [Memory optimization for feeds on Android](https://engineering.fb.com/android/memory-optimization-for-feeds-on-android/) - A technical post I wrote for Facebook's engineering blog, explaining a memory optimization I did on News Feed.
- [Improving Android video on News Feed with Litho](https://engineering.fb.com/android/improving-android-video-on-news-feed-with-litho/) - Another post I wrote for Facebook's blog, this time about work I did on video playback in News Feed. I also [gave a talk](https://atscaleconference.com/videos/video-in-news-feed-using-litho/) about this subject in the Android @Scale 2018 conference.
