Hello! And welcome to my blog!

Here I'll share some of my adventures as a software developer.


If you want to know more about me, you are welcome to enter my "About" page, here on this blog.




On this blog, I'll present all kind of stuff that I did, during all my years as a programmer. Comments are MORE than welcomed! I believe that software engineers should never stop learning, so I'd like to hear if you have found problems or even have better solutions than those I'll post here. It can be a learning experience for all of us.


I’m sure the posts here will benefit both beginners and advanced developers. Initially,
I’ll mainly write stuff for the Android platform, because that's my job, but that's not all. I have lots of side projects on other platforms, so...stick around!


Follow me on Twitter @udinic, to get updated about new posts, and read my interpretation to life.




C ya ;)
