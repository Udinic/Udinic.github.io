Last week I gave a talk about Android performance optimization in a Google's GTUG convention. The subject was "Android: Speed up your app", which is about optimizing your app's performance. I decided to focus on explaining the tools that'll help you find performance problems, instead of just throwing some random tips found on the Internet.

The lecture was videotaped, but of course my bad luck had to intervene. The battery was dead halfway to the lecture, so no recording of that (but I have witnesses!). I decided to write a post, to treasure all that vital/interesting/lost information I gave that day. I wrote that post on my company's blog for a change, so you're all welcome to go there and check it out yourself.
